'''Q1. Inventory Management System (Lists and Strings)

Create a Python program to manage an inventory of products. The program should:

Allow the user to add new products to the inventory.

Display the current inventory list.

Find and display the product with the longest name.

Remove a product by its name (if it exists).

Display the total number of products in the inventory.

Use string manipulation to ensure the product names are case-insensitive 
(e.g., "apple" and "Apple" should be treated as the same). 
Use a list to store the products and allow the user to interact with the inventory system.'''

'''Q2. Palindrome Word Filter

Ask the user for a sentence.

Convert it all to lowercase, split into words, and store them in a list.

Build a new list containing only palindrome words (like "level", "madam").

If a palindromeâ€™s length is odd, store it as a float (its length).

If a palindromeâ€™s length is even, store it as a string ("word-length").

Print the final list.'''

'''Q3. List Compression Challenge

Ask the user for a string of comma-separated values (mix of numbers and words).

Convert them into a list.

For every number, cast it to int and keep only even numbers.

For every word, keep it only if its first letter is a vowel.

Build and print the final filtered list.'''
