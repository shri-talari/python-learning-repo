'''Q5. Quiz Game with File Storage

Problem:
Create a quiz game using file handling.

Questions are stored in a file (questions.txt) in format:
"question|option1,option2,option3|answer"

Program reads questions and asks user.

Userâ€™s answers are stored in answers.txt.

At the end, show:

Score.

Correctly answered questions (set).

Summary dictionary {question: chosen_answer}.

Handle exceptions:

Invalid file format.

File not found.

Invalid user input.'''
