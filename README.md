### 🛠️ Control Structures - Conditionals + Loops + Control statements


**'''Q1. Grade Calculation with Conditions**

Problem:
Write a Python program that takes a student's score as input (integer), checks the score, and prints the corresponding grade based on the following scale:

A: score >= 90

B: 70 <= score < 90

C: 50 <= score < 70

F: score < 50

If the input is not a valid integer, prompt the user again until a valid score is provided.



**Q2. Time Conversion**

Problem:
Create a program that converts a given time in seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds. 
The input should be an integer representing the number of seconds. 
Ensure that the program handles various sizes of input (e.g., converting 3600 seconds to 1 hour, 0 minutes, and 0 seconds). 
Use integer division and modulo operators.



**Q3.Multiplication Table Generator**

Problem:
Write a program that generates the multiplication table for a given number. 
The user should input a number, and the program will output its multiplication table from 1 to 10.



**Q4.Fibonacci Sequence**

Problem:
Write a Python program that generates the first n Fibonacci numbers, where n is provided by the user. 
The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers. 
The program should output the sequence as a list.



**Q5.Currency Converter**

Problem:
Write a program that converts an amount in INR (Indian Rupees) into USD and GBP (user input) based on fixed conversion rates. Assume the conversion rates are as follows:

1 INR = 1 / 83.00 USD

1 INR = 1 / 103.00 GBP

The program should output the equivalent amount in USD and GBP for the entered INR.
You may assume that the user will enter valid numeric input.
