# Python Learning Journey ðŸš€

This repository documents my step-by-step journey of learning **Python**.  
The approach I follow is **cumulative learning** â€” each new branch builds upon the previous one.  
- Start with the basics.  
- Add new concepts.  
- Solve problems that combine **all concepts learned so far**.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repo is organized into branches. Each branch focuses on a specific set of concepts and contains solved problems based on everything learned up to that point.

| Branch Name              | Concepts Covered                                                                 | Problems Solved |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **basics**               | Variables, Data Types, Type Casting, Operators                                   | 4               |
| **control-statements**   | All previous + Conditional Statements, Loops, Control Statements                 | 5               |
| **datatypes-and-collections** | All previous + Strings, Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries                      | 15              |
